# Refactor For Accessibility

## Description

This project updated the Horiseon main landing page to have it meet accessibility standards and to extend our reach to even more clients. In keeping with Horiseon's core value of providing excellent service and exceeding expectations, we have also cleaned up various bugs and tuned up the webpage's inner-workings. 

**Change notes:**
- Changed many divs to be semantics for better accessibility.
- Added alt text.
- Added a website title.
- Added tab icon.
- Clicking on the Hoiseon main title now brings you back to the initial page landing.
- Fixed broken the Search Engine Optimization jump.
- Restructured the ordering in CSS to make more sense hierarchically.
- Condensed the CSS logic with search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing. Now all under the mainContentSection class.
- Condensed the list logic in CSS.
- Added aria label to the ‚ù§Ô∏è in the footer.
- Improved webpage performance involved with displaying some images.
